# sico.descriptors is a set of audio descriptors in gen~ codebox
Inspired by the work of Mikhail Malt & Emmanuel Jourdan, and kindly supported thanks to a close interaction with Mikhail Malt. 
The aim of the project is to simplify the integration of sound analysis and to minimize the problems due to computer obsolescence within the Max environment.
